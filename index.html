                        fellow travelers of the same universe in which I was born and live, some sparks of my

                        With human fraternity and hope… and with all due respect.</p>
                    <p class="searchable">I reaffirm that I consider myself solely as a craftsman and sower, in my own

                        wandering souls, some of these sparks/seeds will find fertile ground, germinate, and bloom… We
                        know
                        we are connected by many threads of different kinds. Beyond all that allows us to create the

                        same
                        mysteries, and awed by the same miracles that life endlessly repeats. No matter how dormant we

                        source—finding reasons and motivations to uplift our spirits and continue our search. To keep

            <section id="home-bio" style=" padding-top: 160px; margin-top: -160px;">


                <article>

                        <img src="img_bio01.jpg" alt="Foto de Ricardo Abril"
                            style="width: 250px; border-radius: 20px; background-color: orangered; padding: 10px; float: right;margin-left: 15px;">
                    </div>
                    <p class="searchable">Having worked since the age of 7, I set out to learn from the world, from
                        people, and from
                        various engaging trades, experiencing the different flavors and colors of existence. I live
                        enamored with the wind and dreams and the constant awakening and blooming of life with each new
                        dawn.</p>
                    <p class="searchable">Fortunately, I never lost my childhood curiosity and wonder, my love for
                        exploring everything,
                        asking questions, conversing, and sharing simply for the joyous pleasure it brings. When I began
                        teaching, I realized that the only way to truly connect with children was to rediscover my own
                        inner child. This led me on an intimate exploration where most of my children's poems blossomed.
                        The sensitivity of the children inspired me to continue down this path.</p>
                    <p class="searchable">I love poetry. Most of the children's
                        poems I have written
                        were discovered between 1975 and 1984, some nearly 50 years ago. They were born and have grown
                        and traveled many paths to pay humble tribute to the magnificent miracle of life and the immense
                        gift and responsibility of being human, of sharing with all of you and with all those who came
                        before, those who are here now, and those who will come after, the privilege of feeling and
                        dreaming. And of being able to express it.</p>
                    <p class="searchable">The other texts correspond to different moments and transits of my personal
                        history and aim to
                        mobilize sensitivities and awareness on themes and issues that the vertiginous urgency of
                        contemporary life leaves aside in function of the haste and efficiency imposed by the model of
                        society we are sharing.</p>
                    <p class="searchable">In the mission that I am about to share, everything I have tried to write and
                        share is framed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="searchable">Mission: "From today until my death, I want to live to understand and help

                            observation,
                            contemplation, and reflection inward into consciousness and outward in the coherence of
                            attitudes and actions.

                    <h3>Children's poetry</h3>
                    <article>
                        <p class="searchable">Simple texts, rich in poetic language, that have wandered for several
                            years through
                            classrooms,
                            homes, family events, social, cultural, and community gatherings, and that aim to reach more
                            hearts that love art and life. They recreate everyday themes and situations in a combined
                            manner
                            with proposals from fantasy and with deep respect for children's sensitivity, being
                            provocative,
                            recitable, and representable. They vindicate the flight of fantasy, sensitivity, and
                            creativity
                            of the child's soul and all sensitive hearts.</p>

                            mid-pandemic year, July 2020 to October 2021. Their contents express feelings, thoughts,
                            anecdotes, reflections, or creations of the author, current, or from some moment in his
                            life.
                            The author respects each and every conviction that each person holds as the driving force of
                            their own consciousness.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p class="searchable">Because the author is now approaching 70 years old and because
                            feeling-thinking is always worthwhile, reflections are proposed in 70-word texts called
                            Septentenas. Their intention is
                            to mobilize sensitivity, the disposition for contemplation, and a healthy critical sense in
                            relation to individual and social human events and activities. This project started in
                            November 2021 and is still in production and dissemination.</p>
