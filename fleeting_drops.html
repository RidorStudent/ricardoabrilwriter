                    started and shared from
                    mid-pandemic year, July 2020 to October 2021. Their contents express feelings, thoughts,

                        <p class="searchable">Deaf to all deafness, here we go, filled with the noise of the world and
                            indifferent to the music
                            of life, even though the canaries and the orioles and all the known and unknown birds still
                            sing, having survived our mad violence against everything that lives, even against
                            ourselves...
                        </p>

                        <p class="searchable">Even though the wind continues to whistle its playful compositions... Even
                            though the voice of
                            our own soul persists, trying to tell us so much... Indifferent to so many voices that warn
                            us,
                            exhort us from so many shores...</p>

                        <p class="searchable">Blind to all blindness, here we go, enraptured by the "spectacle" they put
                            on
                            for us every day
                            from the outside, multicolored and fiery, but coming from the deepest darkness, indifferent
                            not
                            only to the subtle lights of everyday miracles but also to the most illuminated of all great
                            miracles, undeniable: waking up alive each new day of our personal existence, as long as it
                            lasts... Unwilling to look within and toward the essential...</p>

                        <p class="searchable">Mute to all muteness, here we go...</p>

                        <p class="searchable">Worldly, saturated with all worldliness, here we go, without a drop of
                            time to
                            soak the soul, to
                            give it even a drink of silence, to prevent it from dehydrating or dying while alive, to
                            allow
                            it, from its essence, to revere and be grateful...</p>

                        <p class="searchable">This is what there is, we say. And so we go, walking toward a "there" that
                            cries, "Aye!"</p>

                        <p class="searchable">At this moment, as in every moment, the dance of life is filled with
                            multiple
                            miracles happening
                            simultaneously... Silence! Let nothing disturb the night: it is giving birth to dreams...
                        </p>
                        <p class="searchable">The night has just rounded the corner of yesterday and begun to walk,
                            contemplative and smiling,
                            along the path of today's dawn. She feels no labor pains. Birthing dreams is almost, by far,
                            her
                            main function, despite what others may say. And she is happy in this role, a mother so
                            seasoned
                            in the art of procreation and the liturgy of creation. If "The devil's knowledge is rooted
                            in
                            his ancient existence rather than his notorious name" imagine how much the lady night knows,
                            ancient as she is from all antiquity...</p>
                        <p class="searchable">Here and now, her labor is accompanied by rain that soaks her with its
                            music
                            of enamored
                            crystals, which, in total surrender, pour themselves like a caress upon life, which
                            seemingly
                            sleeps.</p>
                        <p class="searchable">Let them be... Let them do... Dawn will come, and many dreamers will be
                            reaching the peak of one
                            or several of their dreams, without imagining that the night and the rain had a hand in it.

                        <p class="searchable">No matter how much we ignore or refuse to accept and embrace it, and no
                            matter
                            our notions of
                            reality and truth, we are here because we were seeds that germinated. From the moment of
                            conception, we began a journey of cycles that we have been fulfilling, and in our case, even
                            as
                            we progress from one to another and inexorably towards the final return, these cycles remain
                            active, renew, and intersect constantly: germinate, grow, bloom, mature, return. Sometimes
                            we
                            stagnate, sometimes we get blocked. But life, of which we are a part, carries on with us,
                            whether we like it or not.</p>
                        <p class="searchable">As germinated seeds, active in any of the vital cycles (not chronological,
                            but
                            existential), even
                            if we ignore or evade it, our vocation is to grow and bloom in the concert of life,
                            multiplying
                            the material and spiritual gifts that keep us standing and that renew, each new day, our
                            possibility to continue learning, sharing, and growing.</p>
                        <p class="searchable">The dynamics of knowing how to give and how to receive from others set the
                            tone and height of our
                            intimate evolution.</p>

                            great
                            love. And within
                            that love, intimately coexist multiple and also great loves; for the rain, for example. Also
                            for
                            the wind, the fire, the earth, humanity, the cosmos, the small yet magnificent daily
                            miracles
                            that life constantly grants us, many of which we do not even perceive, but they are there,
                            blossoming tirelessly.</p>

                        <h3>A Veils and Sleepless Nights</h3>
                        <p class="searchable">There are many recurring sleepless nights, where the soul searches for
                            itself
                            in despair. Such
                            sleeplessness persists, especially in these times filled with dark events, so much
                            bloodshed,
                            and such vile fire, destroying all optimism and nearly all hope. The night remains, if not
                            for
                            everyone, at least for many, an impeccable and relentless mirror of our deepest and most
                            authentic existential anxieties.</p>
                        <p class="searchable">It is inevitable, here and now, to ruminate on impotence, fear, and
                            pessimism
                            about what the
                            world is experiencing. And perhaps, at least for some, to also ruminate on shame, for the
                            share
                            of responsibility that falls upon us and which the mirror of events rubs into our hearts.
                            Before
                            our own conscience, we are never immune, even though we practice such diverse forms of
                            evasion,
                            conformity, and complicity…</p>
