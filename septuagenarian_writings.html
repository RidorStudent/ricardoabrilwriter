                <p class="searchable">Acceptance of brevity as a literary and philosophical value, to capture the
                    attention of a world
                    rushing from one place to another. Capsules of 70 words, invariably challenging the reader's
                    attention, perception, comprehension, self-reflection, and critique.</p>
                <p class="searchable">Because feeling and thinking will always be worthwhile, these 70-word texts offer
                    reflections
                    intended to mobilize sensitivity, a readiness for contemplation, and a healthy critical sense in
                    relation to individual and social human events and activities.</p>

                            everything. We know almost nothing but think we know it all. We are insensitive and
                            indifferent
                            to the gravest human problems but boast about “feeling.” We hardly know ourselves but think

                        <p class="searchable">Fragile, yes, but incorruptible. It has been, by far, the greatest
                            victim of
                            all kinds of
                            attacks, millions of them perpetrated, cold-bloodedly and consciously, in the very
                            souls, even
                            of the most optimistic, by force of seemingly irredeemable realities. It has died so
                            many times,
                            in me, in you, in almost everyone! But it survives and insists on summoning us, knowing
                            that we
                            are nothing without it. Authentic hope requires action, incorruptible.</p>

                        <p class="searchable">Only some children are cared for, with the soul invested. Why is it
                            not so for
                            all the children
                            of the world? We evade a lot on this matter, but here our political conscience plays
                            immensely.
                            And our subtle violences against them, putting barriers to the full expression of their
                            being.
                            And if we are like this with our own, how much apathy and indifference do we exercise
                            towards
                            the tragedy of all the others?</p>

                        <p class="searchable">Each soul knows how much it hurts inside, irremediably, with the
                            passage of
                            time, to regret
                            having regretted before doing something that represented vital flight and transcendence,
                            but we
                            declined, cowed by perverse fears installed from outside or, worse, self-inflicted.
                            Although
                            sometimes open doors are scarce, life always gives us windows to look beyond and fly.
                            But it
                            demands belief in our wings. And the will to act.</p>

                            illusion.
                            But there is a
                            dreaming that connects many human beings, aware of the extinction threats generated by
                            extreme
                            greed and general, also extreme, political insensitivity. It costs a lot because
                            indifference
                            and apathy are growing. While wealth grows for a few, total misery looms over all the
                            rest of
                            us.</p>

                            almost gods. Suddenly, sometimes, a sudden vertigo leads us to the deepest shadow. And

                            there we emerge, with new lessons and new light, grown, almost angels, almost gods. The

                            world, an
                            undesirable one that
                            clumsy humanity has previously built. A bitter reality, against which rebelling is a
                            tormenting,
                            tormented, and almost useless path. Only almost. Because many, despite everything, keep
                            the
                            breath of necessary rebellion and indispensable action for dignity. We curse its
                            planting. We
                            enjoy, indignantly, its invaluable harvest for all.</p>

                            disdain, neglect,
                            insensitivity. Sometimes one stays silent to do the opposite of granting: to strip value
                            from
                            what is heard, seen, or read; there silence is a short-bladed weapon. That wounds and
                            bleeds,
                            sheltered in its own shadow. Perhaps I am a bird shooting at the shotgun of
