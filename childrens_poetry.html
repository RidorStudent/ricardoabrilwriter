                    style="width: 45%; border-radius: 10px; background-color: white; padding: 10px; float: left;margin-right: 15px;border: 4px, solid, orangered;">

                <p class="searchable">In poetry, which is everything and is found everywhere if we choose to see it,
                    words belong to no
                    one in particular. Just like the stars, they are always there for us to gaze at, smell, feel, think,
                    speak, as long as there are no clouds in our hearts. And if there are clouds, let us not forget
                    that the words are still there, always, offering us their music, yearning to be caught and spoken
                    with love.</p>
                <p class="searchable">How many words do we need to discover or perhaps create to build a bridge that
                    truly unites the
                    world in a single struggle for a better life for all?</p>
                <p class="searchable">It is not the fault of words when we use them as knives to hurt others. Nor when
                    we swallow them
                    instead of telling someone that we love them: the father, the mother, the sweetheart, the
                    friend, the dog, the sun, the river, the tree or its shade, the rain... It is not the fault of words
                    when we do not listen to them if they come from others, yet wish to impose them if they are ours.
                    Nor
                    when we betray their innocence (they lend themselves to anything) and imbue them with hatred, or
                    cynicism, or hypocrisy. We could just as easily do the exact opposite.</p>
                <p class="searchable">We are earth made flesh. Earthly heart, earthly throat. Throat: earthen flute
                    through which air,
                    an enchanting sprite, sings if we allow it. Or kills and kills us if we force it. With words, the
                    choice to build or destroy is solely ours. Always. I invite you to be architects of the word,
                    constructing with it spaces of light and love where all human beings can meet and smile
                    gratefully, acknowledging that we are privileged, that life is a miracle, and poetry its finest
                    portrait.</p>
                <p class="searchable">The heart of each word is a music box. If we open that heart and listen to its
                    song, we will
                    immerse ourselves in a world of music and wisdom, for each word will call to its sisters and, little
                    by
                    little, they will gather to form marvelous choirs that reveal simple and beautiful things within
                    us and around us.</p>
                <p class="searchable">Here are my verses, child, sister, brother, friend; they are my discoveries, they
                    have taught me
                    many things, they have sown joy in me. They are yours and everyone's. Take them and play with them
                    if
                    you like. And whenever you wish, seek poetry yourself in the sacred chest of your own heart. You
                    will find countless treasures...</p>
